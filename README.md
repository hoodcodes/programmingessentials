# programmingessentials

This is a repository of my notes for areas I see necessary to help me be successful in my journey as a programmer.  Disclaimer up front for everyone:  This is heavily slanted towards .Net and C# as that is my background.  

It is a living document and will be added to and fleshed out as time permits.  I consider it a personal reference for myself, as well as an exercise to think more deeply about all subjects.  

I have heard it said that 'writing is thinking', so by writing out these aspects of programming myself, I am forcing myself to think.  I am certainly aware that this information is available and probably in better form elsewhere, and that is great.  My intent is to perform the exercise of thinking about each area myself, more deeply, and writing about it comes to mind as a great way to go about it.  And I encourage anyone else to create their own 'programming essentials' notes.     

I have created a table of contents at https://hoodcodes.github.io/programmingessentials/ which has clickable links for each section.
