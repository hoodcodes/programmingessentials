##### Programming Terms, Libraries, Frameworks, etc.

When I first started this page I was thinking of terms that would be helpful for me, but an interesting thing happened as I continued to research for interesting terms:  I found myself with this visualization of talking to stakeholders, folks less technical, and having a really solid definition of something I already know to explain to them which becomes a valuable tool for bridging the gap of understanding between them and us, the engineers.  And that frankly was more inspiring to me, so the terms below are ones that we should all know already anyway, but perhaps these definitions or explanations might be a nice optimization for explaining them to someone else.  Hence - becoming a more articulate professional for all types of audiences.  

 

###### A 
abstraction:  a simplified representation of something more complex.

algorithm:  1.  a set of processes or rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations.  2.  an unambiguous specification of how to solve a class of problems.  3. A list of steps to finish a task.  4.  in plain terms, the basic technique to get the job done!

AJAX:  asynchronous JavaScript and XML.  

antipattern:  a frequently used, but largely ineffective solution to a problem.  The term originally used to refer to a design pattern gone wrong.  

API:  Application programming interface.  

###### B
Backbone.js:  a JS framework with a RESTful JSON interface and is based on the MVP (model-view-presenter) application design paradigm.

Bootstrap:  An open-source collection of tools for creating websites and web applications.  Developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter.  It was created as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools and was originally named "Twitter Blueprint".

Boolean Searching:  developed by George Boole, a 19th century mathematician.  Allows you to combine words and phrases using the words and, or, not (Boolean operators) to limit, broaden, or define your search.  

###### C
CoffeeScript:  a programming language that trans compiles to JavaScript.

cryptography:  a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.  "Crypt" means 'hidden' or 'vault' and "graphy" stands for 'writing'.


###### D
Data Structures:  a method of organization of data so that it can be used efficiently.  Data structures can implement one or more particular abstract data types (ADT), which are the means of specifying the contract of operations and their complexity. 

Decompose:  Break a problem down into smaller pieces.  

design pattern:  a written document that describes a general solution to a design problem that recurs repeatedly in many projects. 

DNS:  Domain Name Service:  The service that translates URLs to IP addresses.  

Django:  A free, open source, web application framework written in Python which follows the MVC framework.


###### E
Express.js:  A Node.js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

extreme programming:  a pragmatic approach to program development that emphasizes business results first, and takes an incremental, get-something-started approach to building the product, using continual testing and revision. 

###### F

flag:  a boolean variable to convey true-false info.

###### G
Git/Github:  a micro web application framework written in Python and based on the Werkzeug toolkit and Jinja2 template engine. 



###### H
HTML:  HyperText Markup Language.  

###### I
IDE (integrated development environment):  a programming environment that has been packaged as an application program, typically consisting of a code editor, a compiler, a debugger, and a GUI builder.  

idempotency:  the ability to execute code repeatedly with the same inputs and get the same output every time.  RESTful services and functional programming subscribe to this concept.  

inheritance:  the ability of hierarchically-arranged objects to acquire attributes and behaviors of objects above them without duplicating the code.

iteration:  a repetitive action or command typically created with programming loops.  

###### J
JQuery:  A cross-platform JS library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.

###### K


###### L
LESS:  A dynamic stylesheet language that can be compiled into CSS and run on the client-side or server-side.  

Linux:  A unix-like computer operating system assempled under the model of free and open-source software development and distribution.

Load Balancing:  a technique used to distribute workloads uniformly across servers or other compute resources to optimize network efficiency, reliability, and capacity.  

Local Storage:  the data placed in local storage is per origin (the comination of protocol, hostmane, and port number as defined in the same-origin policy).


###### M
MongoDB:  a cross-platform document-oriented databae.  Classified as a NOSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic scheamas.

MVC:  Model-View-Controller is a software architectural pattern for implmenting user interfaces.  It divides a given software application into three interconnected parts, so as to separate the internal representations of information from the ways that information is presented to or accepted from the user.



###### N
Node.js:  An open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side web applications.  Node.js applications are written in JS and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OSX, MS Windows, Linux and many more systems.



###### O
OOP:  A programming paradigm based on the concepts of "objects," which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of producures, often known as methods. 

ORM:  a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.  



###### P
paradigm:  a way of doing something.

PHP:  a server-side scripting language designed for web development but also used as a general purpose programming language.  

Polymorphism:  Often referred to as the third pillar of OOP, after encapsulation and inheritance.  Polymorphism is a greek word that means "many-shaped" and it has 2 distinct aspects:  
* At run time, objects of a derived class may be treated as objects of a base class
* Base classes may define and implement virtual methods, and derived classes can override them.  
Example:  A base class is named Shape and has a virtual method Draw.  Derived classes of Shape are Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle.
 
PostGresSql (Postgres):  an object-relational database mgmt. system (ORDBMS) with an emphasis on extensibility and on standards-compliance.  

Python:  a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C++ or Java. 


###### Q


###### R


###### S
SASS:  a scripting language that is interpreted into CSS.  SassScript is the scripting language iself, which consists of two syntaxes.  

###### T


###### U


###### V

verbosity:  the quality of using more words than needed, wordiness.  In software languages, verbose can be construed in positive and negative terms.  Being more verbose might be positive when it comes to exception details, however developers may complain about certain languages needing more lines of code to perform an action than may be necessary in other languages.  It is a double-edged sword in the sense that wordyness can result in more descriptive, readable code, and this is actually very important since the majority of coding a programmer does is fix bugs on, maintain, or enhance existing code.  This concept is also referred to as the expressiveness of a language.  Some of the most verbose languages are JavaScript, C#, Java and PHP, while some of the most efficent include less popular languages such as Haskell, R, Scala, and F#.  Python is one of the less verbose popular languages.  a good summary of the expressiveness of languages can be found here:  https://redmonk.com/dberkholz/2013/03/25/programming-languages-ranked-by-expressiveness/
