Today's best practice is tomorrow's anti-pattern.

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” 
― Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live” 
― John Woods

“I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits.” 
― Kent Beck

“What kind of programmer is so divorced from reality that she thinks she'll get complex software right the first time?” 
― James Alan Gardner, Ascending

“The really good programmers spend a lot of time programming. I haven’t seen very good programmers who don’t spend a lot of time programming. If I don’t program for two or three days, I need to do it. And you get better at it—you get quicker at it. The side effect of writing all this other stuff is that when you get to doing ordinary problems, you can do them very quickly. - Joe Armstrong” 
― Peter Seibel, Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming


“[On identifying talented programmers] It’s just enthusiasm. You ask them what’s the most interesting program they worked on. And then you get them to describe it and its algorithms and what’s going on. If they can’t withstand my questioning on their program, then they’re not good. I’m asking them to describe something they’ve done that they’ve spent blood on. I’ve never met anybody who really did spend blood on something who wasn’t eager to describe what they’ve done and how they did it and why. I let them pick the subject. I don’t pick the subject, so I’m the amateur and they’re the professional in this subject. If they can’t stand an amateur asking them questions about their profession, then they don’t belong. - Ken Thompson” 
― Peter Seibel, Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming

“So if an algorithm is an idealized recipe, a program is the detailed set of instructions for a cooking robot preparing a month of meals for an army while under enemy attack,” 
― Kernighan Brian W.



“Managers of programming projects aren’t always aware that certain programming
issues are matters of religion. If you’re a manager and you try to require compliance
with certain programming practices, you’re inviting your programmers’ ire. Here’s a
list of religious issues:
■ Programming language
■ Indentation style
■ Placing of braces
■ Choice of IDE
■ Commenting style
■ Efficiency vs. readability tradeoffs
■ Choice of methodology—for example, Scrum vs. Extreme Programming vs. evolutionary
delivery
■ Programming utilities
■ Naming conventions
■ Use of gotos
■ Use of global variables
■ Measurements, especially productivity measures such as lines of code per day” 
― Steve McConnell, Code Complete


“The problem with a completely new programming paradigm isn’t learning a new lan‐
guage. After all, everyone reading this has learned numerous computer languages—
language syntax is merely details. The tricky part is learning to think in a different way.” 
― Neal Ford, Functional Thinking

“You are not reading this book because a teacher assigned it to you, you are reading it because you have a desire to learn, and wanting to learn is the biggest advantage you can have.” 
― Cory Althoff, The Self-Taught Programmer: The Definitive Guide to Programming Professionally

“The perfect kind of architecture decision is the one which never has to be made” 
― Robert C. Martin

“We’re all optimists in our profession or we’d be forced to shoot ourselves. - Joshua Bloch” 
― Peter Seibel, Coders at Work: Reflections on the Craft of Programming

“This approach is refreshing because most of the programming books I've read are drier than a camel's fart.” 
― Alan Dipert

“...I’m not saying simple code takes less time to write. You’d think it would since you end up with less total code, but a good solution isn’t an accretion of code, it’s a distillation of it.” 
― Robert Nystrom


“Programming, it turns out, is hard. The fundamental rules are typically simple and clear. But programs built on top of these rules tend to become complex enough to introduce their own rules and complexity. You’re building your own maze, in a way, and you might just get lost in it.” 
― Marijn Haverbeke


“Programmers are not mathematicians, no matter how much we wish and wish for it.” 
― Richard P. Gabriel

“Premature optimization is the root of all evil.” 
― Donald Knuth

“Every programmer is an author.” 
― Sercan Leylek

“Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability.” 
― Edsger W. Dijkstra

“If you're good at the debugger it means you spent a lot of time debugging. I don't want you to be good at the debugger.” 
― Robert C. Martin

“You Can't Write Perfect Software. Did that hurt? It shouldn't. Accept it as an axiom of life. Embrace it. Celebrate it. Because perfect software doesn't exist. No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. It's unlikely that you'll be the first. And unless you accept this as a fact, you'll end up wasting time and energy chasing an impossible dream.” 
― Andrew Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master


“Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code.” 
― Dan Salomon

“I’ve learned over the past few years that comments should be considered smells.” 
― Ron Lisle

“Programming is the art of doing one thing at a time” 
― Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code

"Programmers are isolated. They sit in their cubicle; they don't think about the larger picture. To my mind, a programmer is not an engineer, because an engineer is somebody who starts with a social problem that an organization or a society has and says, "OK, here's this problem that we have- how can we solve it?" The engineer comes up with a clever, cost-effective solution to address that problem, builds it, tests it to make sure it solves the problem. That's engineering.” 
― Philip Greenspun

 A clever person solves a problem.
A wise person AVOIDS it.
 - Albert Einstein

Programming today is a race between software engineers striving to build bigger and better idiot-proof programs, and the Universe trying to produce bigger and better idiots. So far, the Universe is winning.
 - Rich Cook

Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable. - Ralph Johnson

There’s no time to stop for gas, we’re already late - Karin Donker

Everybody Knows:
* Discipline is the best tool.
* Design first, then code.
* Don’t patch bugs out, rewrite them out.
* Don’t test bugs out, DESIGN them out.
 
The significant problems we face cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them. - Albert Einstein


When somebody begins a sentence with “IT WOULD BE NICE IF..” the right thing to do is to wait politely for the speaker to finish. No project ever gets around to the it-would-be-nice features: or if they do, they regret it. Wait for sentences that begin “WE HAVE TO..” and pay close attention, and see if you agree.
 - Tom Van Vleck

Why do we never have time to do it right, but always have time to DO IT OVER?
 - Anonymous

 It’s hard enough to find an error in your code when you’re looking for it; its even harder when you’ve ASSUMED your code is ERROR-FREE. - Steve McConnell


Simple things should be simple, complex things should be POSSIBLE.
The perfect project plan is POSSIBLE if one first documents a list of ALL the UNKNOWNS. - Bill Langley

Software and cathedrals are much the same – first we build them, then we pray.
 FAST. GOOD. CHEAP. Choose any two.
