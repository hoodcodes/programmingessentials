##### Programming Paradigms

“The problem with a completely new programming paradigm isn’t learning a new lan‐
guage. After all, everyone reading this has learned numerous computer languages—
language syntax is merely details. The tricky part is learning to think in a different way.” 
― Neal Ford, Functional Thinking

###### Imperative
Programming with an explicit sequence of commands that update state.


###### Declarative
Programming by specifying the result you want, not how to get it.  

T-SQL and LINQ exhibit this style of programming.  


###### Structured
Programming with clean, goto-free, nested control structures.



###### Procedural
Imperative programming with procedure calls.   



###### Functional (applicative)
Programming with function calls that avoid any global state.

One should be able to execute a functional method over and over with the same inputs and get the same output every time.  Which is another name for idempotency.  

###### Function-Level (Combinator)
Programming with no variables at all.


###### Object-Oriented
Programming by defining objects that send messages to each other.
