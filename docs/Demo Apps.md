##### Demo Apps (Console, Proof of Concept, etc.)



**Console Apps**
Building micro apps that demonstrate a concept, idea, an algorithm, or anything really can be fun actually.  And getting in the habit of making them TDD helps to strengthen your creating more testable, robust code while also giving you that coder's crack in the form of dopamine rushes whenever you get another test to pass.  

Working in .Net Core using VS Code with the CLI enables you to spin up a quick console app and unit test project.  



Tips:

```csharp
// Keep the console open in debug mode.
Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
Console.ReadKey();
```
