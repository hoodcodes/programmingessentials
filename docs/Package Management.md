Best comparison:  https://www.slant.co/versus/4234/17851/~npm_vs_yarn 

YARN:  
Yarn came about to deal with some issues that some of the FANG companies were having with package management

PROS: 
Yarn installs from local cache (if lib is in there - used first)
Yarn installs in parallel - so faster than NPM
Locks down package versions.
Dependencies always installed as same version and in same order every time it is run
Good documentation 


NPM:

PROS:
Compatible with any CLI
Strong community and library of modules available
Part of Node.js distribution - anyone who has Node has likely used it
