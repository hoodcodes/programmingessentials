##### General Coding Best Practices

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” 
― Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs

“Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live” 
― John Woods

“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” 
― Martin Fowler

“Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?” 
― Brian Kernighan


I think the drive to write 'clever' code should be predominantly in the aim of more efficient execution - and that is it.  Otherwise, write your code so the next person after you can understand what the intent was quickly and without much thought.  Code should be for humans.  And therefore, let's code for the next person so they can make quick sense of what they are looking at. 




“Some of the best programming is done on paper, really. Putting it into the computer is just a minor detail.” 
― Max Kanat-Alexander, Code Simplicity: The Fundamentals of Software

“...I’m not saying simple code takes less time to write. You’d think it would since you end up with less total code, but a good solution isn’t an accretion of code, it’s a distillation of it.” 
― Robert Nystrom

“So if you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.” 
― Robert C. Martin, Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
