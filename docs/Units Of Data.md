Nibble:  (Half a byte) 4 bits in size.

Byte:  (octet) 8 bits.  Can hold a number between 0 and 255 (256 numbers). One byte can store one character, e.g. 'A' or 'x' or '$'

Word:  four bytes.  

integer:  4 bytes 

long:  8 bytes





ASCII - an encoding representing each typed character by a number.  Each number is stored in 1 byte (so the number is in 0..255)

Unicode - stores as 2 bytes per character.  Used for encoding mandarin, greek, arabic etc. languages
