"Rules of Optimization:
Rule 1: Don't do it.
Rule 2 (for experts only): Don't do it yet. ” - Michael A. Jackson

Brogrammer: A programmer who breaks the usual expectations of quiet nerdiness and opts instead for the usual trappings of a frat-boy: popped collars, bad beer, and calling everybody “bro”. Despised by everyone, especially other programmers.

Counterbug: A defensive move useful for code reviews. If someone reviewing your code presents you with a bug that’s your fault, you counter with a counterbug: a bug caused by the reviewer.

Hydra: A bug that, when an attempt to fix is made, introduces two new bugs. It’s a bug that cannot be fixed.

Jenga code: The whole program collapses once you alter a block of code.

Jimmy: A generalized name for a clueless or new developer.

Mulletware: All business in the front, party in the back.

Refuctoring: The process of taking a well-designed piece of code and, through a series of small, reversible changes, making it completely unmaintainable by anyone except yourself.
