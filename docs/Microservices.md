<ins>Areas where there are requirements which in general will be enforced across all development projects:<ins>  
	• Hosting
	• Architecture
	• Compliance
	• Encryption 
	• UX – Design Thinking 
	• Development 
	• Documentation 
	• Testing – could be a bullet point bec it hits upon UX and Software 
	

<ins>Host Requirements:<ins>  
	• All Services will be 'Cloud Native' with the aim to be 'Cloud Agnostic'
	• Cloud Native:   An approach to building and running applications that exploit the advantages of the cloud computing delivery model.  It is about 'how' application are created and deployed, not where.  
		○ Cloud Native Benefits:
	• Cloud Agnostic:  Having the capacity to move from one cloud provider to another without much impact to the IT Systems and business processes.
		○ Cloud Agnostic Benefits:

<ins>User Experience Philosophy<ins>
	• Joey's items -  ( E.g. Implementation of our own Design System that enforces visual and interaction consistency, as well as speeds up developer productivity with an elevated level of clarity on what exactly is being built at the presentation layer.)
	•  


<ins>Architecture Requirements:<ins>
	• Use of Microservices 
		○ Easier to build and maintain (lower TCO)
		○ Organized around business capabilities
		○ Flexible in Using Technologies and Scalability
		
	• API Gateways to access our services
	• Observability / Structured Logging 
	• Continuous Integration and Delivery  
	• Loosely coupled 
	• Unit testable
	• Containerized code  
	• Using the right tools for the right job. Examples:
		○ Cloud Host Provider
		○ Relational and Non-Relational databases
		○ Message Queues 
		
		
		
		
		


<ins>Development Requirements:<ins>  
	• Requirements Gathering
		○ User Stories are vetted by a cross-functional team
		○ Architected to be consistent with long-term strategy for creating scalable, performant, and affordable systems.  
		○ Design System
	• Software Development 
	• Development Disciplines
	• Testing
