##### User Interface Design


“That's the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.” 
― Larry Niven

“We see a lot of feature-driven product design in which the cost of features is not properly accounted. Features can have a negative value to customers because they make the products more difficult to understand and use. We are finding that people like products that just work. It turns out that designs that just work are much harder to produce that designs that assemble long lists of features.” 
― Douglas Crockford, JavaScript: The Good Parts
