##### Testing


“Don't gloss over a routine or piece of code involved in the bug because you "know" it works. Prove it. Prove it in this context, with this data, with these boundary conditions.” 
― Andrew Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master

“Tests are stories we tell the next generation of programmers on a project.” 
― Roy Osherove, The Art of Unit Testing: With Examples in .NET

“Software testing is a sport like hunting, it's bughunting.” 
― Amit Kalantri

“Code without tests is bad code. It doesn't matter how well written it is; it doesn't matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don't know if our code is getting better or worse.” 
― Michael Feathers, Working Effectively with Legacy Code


“Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software-development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find.” 
― Steve McConnell, Code Complete

Most of the studies show between 40–80% reduction in shipping bugs as a result of writing tests before you implement features.

Mocking

Mock functions:  Erase the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function ( and the parameters passed in those calls).
