<ins>Step 1:  Getting the Big Picture<ins>

Main questions:  
What is this about?
How big is this thing?
How can it be broken up?  

Essentially we are looking to find out what the unknowns are on this thing.  

Researching online can provide some fast info for this part.  


<ins>Step 2:  Defining What To Learn<ins>  

Narrow the topic down to what is important to you at this time.  


<ins>Step 3:  Defining Success <ins> 

Start at the end - and then work your way back to where you are at now.  This will help you create incremental goals for improvement  


<ins>Step 4:  Find Resources<ins>  

Do some brainstorming here.  might find people, blogs, podcasts, books, articles, 

Go to Amazon - searching for books 
Go to Google - search for material
Go to Twitter - look for people involved in the topic



<ins>Step 5:  Create a Learning Plan<ins>  

take your scoped topic and create your own modules / steps .  Think about the order in which you need to learn things

try looking at TOC of books, or videos, blogposts, - how have other people broken up their topic?  Kinda copy that.  

great way to check out TOC for books - go to Amazon, and use the ‘Look Inside’ feature to see the TOC of any books on your subject.  

Books are generally the best way.  If you cannot find some commonality from several books on your topic - move on to any online tutorials you can find online.  Definitely find multiple sources.  




<ins>Step 6:  Filter Your Resources<ins>  

Minimize the tendency to grab everything you can find, and then develop that feeling of being overwhelmed with so much data to consume.  

Some sources are better than others.  Qualify several good sources and stick with that.
